Improvements to your on-demand listening Hi Steve, We have added new on-demand features to give you more control over your listening experience. This is an addition to millions of songs ad-free in shuffle mode. You can create your own playlist with your favourite songs and listen with unlimited skips and offline. We’ve improved your selection of All-Access Playlists. These are playlists personalized for you and always available to listen on-demand and offline. We’ve created a new playlist just for you called ‘My Mix’. It refreshes daily based on your music tastes and listening history. Each week, we make select new release albums from top artists available on-demand for a limited time. Learn how to manage your listening experience on the Amazon Music mobile app or web here.
